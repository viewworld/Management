\section{Introduction}
The ViewWorld back end system is designed to be highly modular, giving
the advantage of high reliability of loosely connected
components\footnote{``No single point of failure''}, the possibility to
achieve low latency based on location as well as easy exchange of
single components without affecting the overall system.\\
In order to achieve this, ViewWorld is using the cloud
computing resources provided by Amazon Web
Services\footnote{\href{http://aws.amazon.com}{http://aws.amazon.com}}.
Amazon guarantees impressive uptime and availability, as well as
locations across the globe which satisfies ViewWorlds goals of high
availability as well as low latency.\\
ViewWorld uses Amazons EC2 service for hosting our back end servers and
Amazons S3 service for hosting static content. In addition to Amazons
own backup and safety routines, ViewWorld also ensures backup of our
customers data.

\section{The ViewWorld servers}
ViewWorlds servers are running in Amazons EC2 service hosted in two
locations. The primary location is Europe (Ireland), with USA as a
secondary location in the unlikely case of disruption in the European
location. Currently progress is being made on using Amazons Elastic
Load Balancing service to further guarantee availability.\\
The servers handling the data received from the mobile application as
well as serving the website contents are based on RedHat Enterprise
Linux servers running the Apache Web Server and using the Django Web
Framework.\\
The report data received from the mobile application is stored in a
native XML database\footnote{Currently \href{exist-db.org}{eXist}}
running separately from the web servers receiving and serving the
contents. This helps achieve the goals of a modular design.

\section{How ViewWorld stores content}
ViewWorld uses the Amazon S3 Simple Storage Service for storing data
associated with uploaded reports (e.g. images, video etc.). The S3
service stores the data on multiple devices, which enables Amazon to
claim high reliability. ViewWorld uses the storage services build in
versioning capabilities to ensure rollback is possible in case data
inadvertently get overwritten when a report is updated.\\
ViewWorld is currently working on providing data through Amazons
Cloudfront service in order to minimize latency.

\section{Backup}
In addition to the guarantees given by Amazon concerning reliability,
ViewWorld also maintains our own backup of the database where the
reports are stored and the user database where the users and groups
are stored.\\
This is done by dumping the contents of the databases into a dedicated
backup area using the Amazon S3 storage service twice a day. Since the
backup has versioning enabled, it is possible to revert to a previous
version of the data in case some data was inadvertently deleted by the
user.
